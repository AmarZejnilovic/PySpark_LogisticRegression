# PySpark_LogisticRegression

In this project, the famous Titanic dataset is analysed, using the PySpark and logistic regression algorithm. The goal is to predict whether the person survived or not, based on different input data (features). The code written here could be used for much big datasets as well.

In order to run this code, you need to have installed Virtual Machine on your PC. One of the alternatives is to run the code on databricks. Just import the data properly, and the rest of the code is the same
